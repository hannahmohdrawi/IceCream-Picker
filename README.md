## Description
Created as part of CFG Introduction to JavaScript Course Assignment for Week 2. </br>
The focus on this project was the following: 
  * Use if...else and conditions using comparison operators (==, ===, !=,!==, >, <, ...) or logical operators (&&, ||, !) to make decisions
  * Use a function to group code
  * Use let to create a variable and then reassign it
  * Share your pen (or pens!) on slack
Bonus?
  * Use functions with one or more return statements
  * Combine multiple logical operators (&&, ||, !) in a condition
  * Investigate how comparison operators work with Strings
  * Research and use a switch case statement
  * Format your code neatly and use helpful variable names
